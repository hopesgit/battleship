Welcome to Battleship! This repo contains a fully-playable version of Battleship that can be run in your command line. Just run the runner file when you wish to play!

As of right now, this is the base version of the game. As such, the board size is limited to a 4 x 4 grid for each player. There is also no option for a human player 2. Player 2 is a CPU.

Planned expansions:
- Customizable board size, decided on by the player (the default will still be 4 x 4 unless specified)
- Custom ships, also created by the player
- More intelligent CPU player (base expectations is for the CPU to attack randomly)

We hope you enjoy our game!
